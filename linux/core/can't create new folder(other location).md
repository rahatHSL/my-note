```bash
# Iâ€™m dual booting between RHEL 8 and Windows 10 and the NTFS drive I use to share data between my two operating systems was suddenly mounted Read Only on Linux.

[root@rhel8 mnt]# umount -l /dev/sda1
[root@rhel8 mnt]# mount -t ntfs-3g -o rw /dev/sda1 /mnt/data
The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)

# To fix the issue, I need the ntfsfix application:
[root@rhel8 ~]# dnf whatprovides ntfsfix

[root@rhel8 ~]# dnf install -y ntfsprogs

# Then I ran ntfsfix against /dev/sda1:
