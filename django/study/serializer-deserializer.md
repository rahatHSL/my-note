# defination:
SERIALIZER: Serializer is the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (in a file or memory data buffer) or transmitted (over a computer network) and reconstructed later.

DESERIALIZER: Deserialization is the reverse process; taking the raw data (from a file or from an incoming network socket) and reconstructing the object model.
