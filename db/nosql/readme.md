## NoSQL (Not only SQL)

### defination
```
NoSQL Database is a non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema. It avoids joins, and is easy to scale. The major purpose of using a NoSQL database is for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps.

### advantages
```
01) Big-data capability
02) High scalability | horizontal scaling | low cost
03) High Availability | highly available because in case of any failure data replicates itself to the previous consistent state
